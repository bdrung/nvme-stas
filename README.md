# STorage Appliance Services (STAS)

What does nvme-stas provide?

- A Central Discovery Controller (CDC) client for Linux
- Asynchronous Event Notifications (AEN) handling
- Automated NVMe subsystem connection controls
- Error handling and reporting
- Automatic (zeroconf) and Manual configuration

## Overview

STAS is composed of two services, STAF and STAC, running on the Host computer.

**STAF** - **STorage Appliance Finder**. The tasks performed by STAF include:

- Register with the Avahi daemon for service type `_nvme-disc._tcp`. This allows STAF to locate Central or Direct Discovery Controllers (CDC, DDC) with zero-touch provisioning (ZTP). STAF also allows users to manually enter CDCs and DDCs in a configuration file (`/etc/stas/stafd.conf`) when users prefer not to use ZTP.
- Connect to discovered or configured CDCs or DDCs.
- Retrieve the list of storage subsystems using the "get log page" command.
- Maintain a cache of the discovered storage subsystems.
- Provide a D-Bus interface where 3rd party applications can retrieve the data about the Discovery Controller connections (e.g. log pages).

**STAC** - **STorage Appliance Connector**. The tasks performed by STAC include:

- Read the list of storage subsystems from STAF over D-Bus.
- Similar to STAF, STAC can also read a list of storage subsystems to connect to from a configuration file.
- Set up the I/O controller connections.
- Provide a D-Bus interface where 3rd party applications can retrieve data about the I/O controller connections.

## Design

**`stafd`** and **`stacd`** use the GLib main loop. The GLib Python module provides several low-level building blocks that are needed by **`stafd`** and **`stacd`**. In addition, many Python modules "play nice" with GLib such as `dasbus` and `pyudev`. GLib also provides additional components such as timers, signal handlers, and much more.

**`stafd`** connects to the `avahi-daemon`, which it uses to detect Central Discovery Controllers (CDC) and Direct Discovery Controllers (DDC). When Discovery Controllers (DC) are found with Avahi's help, **`stafd`** uses `libnvme` to set up persistent connections and retrieve the discovery log pages.

## Daemonization

**`stafd`** and **`stacd`** are managed as `systemd` services. The following operations are supported (here showing only `stafd`, but the same operations apply to `stacd`):

- `systemctl start stafd`. Start daemon.
- `systemctl stop stafd`. Stop daemon. The `SIGTERM` signal is used to tell the daemon to stop.
- `systemctl restart stafd`. Effectively a `stop` + `start`.
- `systemctl reload stafd`. Reload configuration. This is done in real time without restarting the daemon. The `SIGHUP` signal is used to tell the daemon to reload its configuration file.

## Configuration

As stated before, **`stafd`** can automatically locate discovery controllers with the help of Avahi and connect to them, and **`stacd`** can automatically set up the I/O connections to discovered storage subsystems. However, **`stafd`** and **`stacd`** can also operate in a non-automatic mode based on manually entered configuration. In other words, discovery controllers and/or storage subsystems can be entered manually. This is again to provide customers with more flexibility. The configuration for each daemon is found in **`/etc/stas/stafd.conf`** and **`/etc/stas/stacd.conf`** respectively. The configuration files also provide additional parameters, such as log-level attributes used mainly for debugging purposes.

## D-Bus interface

The interface to **`stafd`** and **`stacd`** is D-Bus. This allows other programs, such as **`stafctl`** and **`stacctl`**, to communicate with the daemons. This also provides third parties the ability to write their own applications that can interact with **`stafd`** and **`stacd`**. For example, someone could decide to write a GUI where they would display the discovery controllers as well as the all the discovery log pages in a "pretty" window. The next table provides info about the two D-Bus interfaces.

| Component | D-Bus address                  |
| --------- | ------------------------------ |
| `stafd`   | **`org.nvmexpress.staf.conf`** |
| `stacd`   | **`org.nvmexpress.stac.conf`** |

## Companion programs: `stafctl` and `stacctl`

**`stafctl`** and **`stacctl`** are utilities that allow users to interact with **`stafd`** and **`stacd`** respectively. This is a model used by several programs, such as `systemctl` with `systemd`.

At a minimum, these utilities provide debug tools, but they could also provide some configuration capabilities (TBD).

## Packages

**`stafd`** and **`stacd`** as well as their companion programs **`stafctl`** and **`stacctl`** are released together in a package called "**`nvme-stas`**" for **ST**orage **A**pplicance **S**ervices (e.g. `stas-1.0.0-1.x86_64.rpm` or `stas_1.0.0_amd64.deb`).

## Dependencies

 **`stafd`**/**`stacd`** require Linux kernel 5.14 or later. 

The following packages must be installed to use **`stafd`**/**`stacd`**

**Debian packages (tested on Ubuntu 20.04):**

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y python3-pyudev python3-systemd python3-gi
sudo pip3 install dasbus
```

**Yum packages (tested on Fedora 34):**

```bash
sudo dnf install -y python3-dasbus python3-pyudev python3-systemd python3-gobject
```

Additionally, the `libnvme` library (with Python bindings) needs to be installed. Currently only available from source at: https://github.com/linux-nvme/libnvme

# STAF - STorage Appliance Finder


| Component | Description                                              |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`/usr/sbin/stafd`** | A daemon that finds (discovers) NVMe storage appliances. |
| **`/usr/bin/stafctl`** | A companion shell utility for `stafd`.                  |
| **`/etc/stas/stafd.conf`** | Configuration file |

## stafd configuration file

The configuration file is named `/etc/stas/stafd.conf`. This file contains configuration parameters for the **`stafd`** daemon. One of the things you may want to configure is the IP address of the discovery controller(s) you want **`stafd`** to connect to. The configuration file contains a description of all the parameters that can be configured.

## Service discovery with Avahi

**`stafd`** can automatically find and set up connections to Discovery Controllers. To do this, **`stafd`** registers with the [Avahi](https://www.avahi.org/), the mDNS/DNS-SD (Service Discovery) daemon. Discovery Controllers that advertise themselves with service type `_nvme-disc._tcp` will be recognized by Avahi, which will inform **`stafd`**.

# STAC - STorage Appliance Connector


| File name                  | Description                                        |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **`/usr/sbin/stacd`**      | A daemon that connects to NVMe storage appliances. |
| **`/usr/bin/stacctl`**     | A companion shell utility for `stacd`.             |
| **`/etc/stas/stacd.conf`** | Configuration file                                 |

## stacd configuration file

The configuration file is named `/etc/stas/stacd.conf`. In this file you can configure storage appliances that **`stacd`** will connect to. By default, **`stacd`** uses information (log pages) collected from **`stafd`** to connect to storage appliances. However, you can also manually enter IP addresses of storage appliances in this file.

# Build, install, unit tests

STAS uses the `meson` build system. Since STAS is a Python project, there is no code to build. However, the code needs to be installed using `meson`. Once installed, unit tests can be run with `meson` as well.

## Using meson

Invoke `meson` to configure the project:

```bash
meson .build
```

Note that the first line, `meson .build`, need only be called once. This analyzes the project and the host computer to determine if all the necessary tools are available. The result is in the directory named `.build`.

Do as follows to install the code:

```bash
cd .build
meson install
```

Do as follows to run the unit tests:

```bash
cd .build
meson test
```

## Alternate approach using Good-ole make

Recognizing that many people are not familiar with `meson`, we're providing a second way to install the code using the more familiar `configure` script combined with a `make`.

```bash
./configure
make
```

This performs the same operations as the meson approach described above. The `configure` script simply invokes `meson .build` and generates a `Makefile`. The generated `Makefile` provides the following operations.

| make command       | Corresponding commands using meson                           |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **`make`**         | Doesn't really do anything since there is nothing to build. However, this can be used to update the meson configuration after modifying `meson.build` files. |
| **`make install`** | cd .build; meson install                                     |
| **`make test`**    | cd .build; meson test                                        |
| **`make clean`**   | Clean build artifacts, but does not remove the meson's configuration. That is, the `.build` directory is preserved. |
| **`make purge`**   | Remove all build artifacts including the `.build` directory. If you want to build the code after running this command, you will need to first run `./configure`. |

## Compiling and running nvme-stas in a docker container

TBD

dependencies: dbus, avahi.

## Generating man and html pages

nvme-stas uses the following programs to generate the documentation. These can be installed as shown in the "dependencies" section.

- `xsltproc` - Used to convert DocBook XML notation to "man pages" and "html pages".
- `gdbus-codegen` - Used to convert D-Bus IDL to DocBook XML notation.

### Dependencies

The following packages must be installed to generate the documentation

**Debian packages (tested on Ubuntu 20.04):**

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y docbook-xml docbook-xsl xsltproc libglib2.0-dev
```

**Yum packages (tested on Fedora 34):**

```bash
sudo dnf install -y docbook-style-xsl libxslt glib2-devel
```

### Configuring to build the man and html pages

By default, the documentation is not built. You need to run the `configure`  as follows to tell meson that you want to build the documentation. You may need to first purge any previous configuration.

```bash
make purge
./configure -Dman=true -Dhtml=true
make
```
