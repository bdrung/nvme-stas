[Host]
# nqn:     The host's unique Non-Qualified Name. A value starting with "file://"
#          indicates that the Host NQN can be retrieved from a separate file.
#          Typically, nvme-cli saves the Host NQN in /etc/nvme/hostnqn. For
#          compatibility with nvme-cli, nvme-stas defaults to looking for the
#          existance of this file and will read the NQN from it. Otherwise, you
#          can overwrite the default NQN by specifying its value here or
#          specifying another file that contains the Host NQN to use.
#          Type: string
#          Default: file:///etc/nvme/hostnqn
#nqn=file:///etc/nvme/hostnqn


# id:      The host's unique Identifier (ID). A value starting with "file://"
#          indicates that the Host ID can be retrieved from a separate file.
#          Typically, nvme-cli saves the Host ID in /etc/nvme/hostid. For
#          compatibility with nvme-cli, nvme-stas defaults to looking for the
#          existance of this file and will read the ID from it. Otherwise, you
#          can overwrite the default ID by specifying its value here or
#          specifying another file that contains the Host ID to use.
#          Type: string
#          Default: file:///etc/nvme/hostid
#id=file:///etc/nvme/hostid


# symname: The host's symbolic name. This can be a string or the name of a file
#          containing the symbolic name. A value starting with "file://"
#          indicates that the Symbolic Name can be retrieved from a separate
#          file.
#          Type: string
#          Default: There is no default. The symbolic name is undefined by
#                   default.
