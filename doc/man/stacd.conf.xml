                            Takes a boolean argument. This option controls how
                            connections with I/O Controllers (IOC) are made.

                            There is no guarantee that there will be a route to
                            reach that IOC. However, we can use the socket
                            option SO_BINDTODEVICE to force the connection to be
                            made on a specific interface instead of letting the
                            routing tables decide where to make the connection.
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            This option determines whether <code>stacd</code> will use
                            SO_BINDTODEVICE to force connections on an interface
                            or just rely on the routing tables. The default is
                            to use SO_BINDTODEVICE, in other words, <code>stacd</code> does
                            not ignore the interface.
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            BACKGROUND:
                            By default, <code>stacd</code> will connect to IOCs on the same
                            interface that was used to retrieve the discovery
                            log pages. If stafd discovers a DC on an interface
                            using mDNS, and stafd connects to that DC and
                            retrieves the log pages, it is expected that the
                            storage subsystems listed in the log pages are
                            reachable on the same interface where the DC was
                            discovered.
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            For example, let's say a DC is discovered on
                            interface ens102. Then all the subsystems listed in
                            the log pages retrieved from that DC must be
                            reachable on interface ens102. If this doesn't work,
                            for example you cannot "ping -I ens102 [storage-ip]",
                            then the most likely explanation is that arp proxy
                            is not enabled on the switch that the host is
                            connected to on interface ens102. Whatever you do,
                            resist the temptation to manually set up the routing
                            tables or to add alternate routes going over a
                            different interface than the one where the DC is
                            located. That simply won't work. Make sure arp proxy
                            is enabled on the switch first.
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            Setting routes won't work because, by default, <code>stacd</code>
                            uses the SO_BINDTODEVICE socket option when it
                            connects to IOCs. This option is used to force a
                            socket connection to be made on a specific interface
                            instead of letting the routing tables decide where
                            to connect the socket. Even if you were to manually
                            configure an alternate route on a different interface,
                            the connections (i.e. host to IOC) will still be
                            made on the interface where the DC was discovered by
                            stafd.

                        <para>
                            Takes a string argument <literal>enabled</literal> or
                            <literal>disabled</literal>. This option determines
                            whether <code>nvme-cli</code>'s udev rule will be executed
                            or ignored.
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            A udev rule gets installed with <code>nvme-cli</code>
                            that tells the udev daemon (<code>udevd</code>) to look
                            for Asynchronous Event Notifications (AEN) indicating
                            a change of Discovery Log Page Entries (DPLE). The
                            udev rule is installed as: <filename>/usr/lib/udev/rules.d/70-nvmf-autoconnect.rules</filename>
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            When an AEN is detected, <code>udevd</code> simply
                            instructs <code>systemd</code> to start a one-shot
                            service that will retrieve the changed DPLEs and
                            connect to all the I/O Controllers (IOC) listed in
                            the DPLEs. This is basically the same as performing
                            <code>nvme-cli</code>'s "<code>connect-all</code>"
                            command.
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            Unfortunately, <code>stafd</code> and <code>stacd</code>
                            also perform the same operations when an AEN is received.
                            This results in a race condition between <code>udevd</code>
                            and <code>stafd</code>/<code>stacd</code>.
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            This is not really a problem. <code>stafd</code> and
                            <code>stacd</code> are designed to handle this type
                            of race condition and will conclude, eventually, that
                            the connections succeeded. The only downside is that
                            there may be error messages printed to the syslog
                            when the race condition happens. These messages are
                            printed by the kernel because two processes are trying
                            to connect to the same IOC at the same time. One of
                            them will be rejected by the kernel, but the other
                            will succeed.
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            The <code>udev-rule</code> option allows a user to
                            disable <code>nvme-cli</code>'s udev rule so that <code>udevd</code> will
                            not act on received AENs. Instead, only
                            <code>stafd</code>/<code>stacd</code> will be allowed
                            to react to AENs and set up IOC connections.
                        </para>

                        <para>
                            Defaults to <literal>enabled</literal>, which means
                            that <code>udevd</code> and <code>stafd</code>/<code>stacd</code>
                            will react to AENs. It also means that the race condition
                            will happen by default and error messages will be
                            printed to the syslog.

                            removal of a <literal>controller=</literal> entry in

                                Zoning configuration is performed at Discovery
                                Controllers (DC). A zone is used to specify the list
                                of IOC that a host is allowed to access.
                                The zone contains a list of hosts and the IOC
                                that these hosts can access. Users can add or
                                remove IOC and/or hosts from zones.

                                DCs notify hosts of zoning configuration changes by
                                sending Asynchronous Event Notifications (AEN)
                                indicating a "Change of Discovery Log Page (DLP)".
                                The host uses these AENs as a trigger to retrieve the
                                new list of DLPEs by issuing a Get DLP command.
                                This happens in real time, which means that a host
                                that was previously connected to an IOC may
                                suddenly be told that it is no longer allowed to
                                connect to that IOC and should disconnect from it.

                                        zoning at a DC will result in the host getting
                                        a new list of DLPEs. On DLPE removal, the host
                                        should remove the connection to the IOC matching
                                        that DLPE.

                            removed by a system reboot. They don't want for IOC
